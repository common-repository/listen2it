###### Why Audio Articles?

The modern-day audience is constantly multi-tasking across multiple kinds of devices they use.  At work, while driving, while commuting, while cooking or just lazing around, people are consuming content in a variety of life situations every day. By offering just text content you are losing out on the opportunity to engage your audience in a variety of these situations.

Audio (specifically spoken audio and/or podcasts) has emerged as a preferred content format for this modern audience. Most of your readers are already listening to a variety of content. According to NPR and Edison Research, close to 2/3rds of listeners now prefer it over reading.

Audio versions of your content also give you a strong tool to stand out in the crowded content landscape. Listeners constantly show a much higher time-on-site, and higher attention and remember more content. You can also offer it as a value-added service to grow your subscriber base.

So go ahead, grow your audience with audio. It’s easy!
